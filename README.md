# AI Project - Plastic Bottle Label Detection

A deep learning project that detects plastic bottles and classifies them as **with label** or **without label**. The system integrates a trained CNN classifier with a YOLO object detector and connects to an ESP32 microcontroller to control LEDs:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green LED â†’ Bottle with label
- ðŸ”´ Red LED â†’ Bottle without label

## Usage

### Real-time Detection
```bash
uv run python camera_detection.py
```
- Detects bottles in live video stream using YOLO.  
- Classifies each bottle ROI as **with_label** or **without_label** using CNN.  
- Shows results on the screen and sends output to ESP32.  

### Model Evaluation
```bash
uv run python test_evaluation.py
```
- Runs evaluation on ~200+ test images.  
- Reports Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 98.67%
- **Precision (with_label)**: 97.78%
- **Recall (with_label)**: 99.77%
- **F1-Score (with_label)**: 98.77%
- **Precision (without_label)**: 99.74%
- **Recall (without_label)**: 97.42%
- **F1-Score (without_label)**: 98.57%

**Key Findings**:  
- CNN + YOLO pipeline is effective for distinguishing labeled vs. unlabeled bottles.  
- Dataset diversity improves robustness.  
- Integration with ESP32 enables real-time hardware feedback.

## Hardware Integration (ESP32)

- ðŸŸ¢ Green LED lights up if bottle has a label.  
- ðŸ”´ Red LED lights up if bottle has no label.  
- Communication via serial between PC and ESP32.
